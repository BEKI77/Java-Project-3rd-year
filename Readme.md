# Encryption and Decryption Tool

The Encryption and Decryption Tool is a program that allows you to encrypt and decrypt data using various encryption algorithms. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting data, selecting encryption algorithms, and managing keys.

## Features

# - Supports multiple encryption algorithms, including AES, DES, and RSA.
# - Key generation, storage, and retrieval functionality.
- Input handling for reading plaintext or ciphertext from files.
- Output handling for displaying encrypted or decrypted data and writing output to files.
# - User interface for a graphical user interface (GUI) interaction.
- Exception handling for capturing and handling errors during encryption and decryption processes.
